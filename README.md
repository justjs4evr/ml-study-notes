Hi! I am a KMLA student, 30th waver, CDY.

Currently learning Machine Learning, Physics, Calculus, Linear Algebra, etc.
I am reviewing "machine learning with pytorch and scikit-learn" by Raschka, while learning the "machine learning for algorithmic trading" by Jansen

In each chapter of the Raschka, I included practice examples that i did to focus on memorizing & implementing sklearn code patterns
