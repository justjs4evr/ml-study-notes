# Machine Learning Study Log

## 👨‍💻 About Me

**Hi! I am a KMLA student, 30th waver, CDY.**

I am currently diving deep into the intersection of Computer Science and Natural Sciences, focusing on:

* **Machine Learning** (Statistical Learning Theory, Reinforcement Learning)
* **Physics** (Mechanics, Electromagnetism)
* **Mathematics** (Calculus, Linear Algebra)

My long-term goal involves developing next-generation chip architectures optimized for AI operations.

## 📚 Current Study Roadmap

I am simultaneously reviewing and learning from three core texts to bridge theory, implementation, and application:

| Focus Area | Textbook / Resource | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Core ML & DL** | *Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn* (Raschka et al.) | **Main Focus of this Repo** |
| **Finance** | *Machine Learning for Algorithmic Trading* (Stefan Jansen) | *Supplementary Study* |
| **Biology** | *Deep Learning for Biology* (Ravarani et al.) | *Supplementary Study* |

## 📂 Repository Focus: Raschka's ML

This repository is primarily a code-along and practice log for **"Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn"**.

My goal here is **fluency**. Rather than just copying code, I am rewriting practice examples to focus on **memorizing and implementing Scikit-Learn/PyTorch code patterns** without reliance on external documentation.

### Structure

Each chapter folder contains:

1. **`practice_*.py`**: Implementations focusing on specific `sklearn` patterns (pipelines, transformers) or PyTorch training loops.
2. **`notes.md`**: Key concepts, mathematical derivations, or API nuances I need to remember.

| Chapter | Topic | Key Concepts / Patterns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Ch 01-03** | **Simple ML** | Perceptrons, Adaline, Logistic Regression logic. |
| **Ch 04** | **Data Preprocessing** | `StandardScaler`, `SimpleImputer`, Handling categorical data. |
| **Ch 06** | **Model Evaluation** | K-Fold CV, Learning Curves, `GridSearchCV`. |
| **Ch 12+** | **PyTorch** | Tensors, Autograd, `nn.Module`. |
