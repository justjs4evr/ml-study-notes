## 👨‍💻 About Me
**Hi! I am a KMLA student, 30th waver, CDY.**

I am currently diving deep into the intersection of Computer Science and Natural Sciences, building a foundation in:
* **Machine Learning** (Statistical Learning Theory, Deep Reinforcement Learning)
* **Physics** (Mechanics, Electromagnetism)
* **Mathematics** (Calculus, Linear Algebra)

My long-term goal is to contribute to next-generation chip architectures optimized for AI operations.

## 📚 Study Context
I am reviewing and learning from three core texts simultaneously. This repository is dedicated to the **first** text in this list:

1.  **[MAIN] Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn (Raschka et al.)**
    * *Goal:* Code fluency, mastering `sklearn` pipelines, and understanding PyTorch internals.
2.  **[SIDE] Machine Learning for Algorithmic Trading (Stefan Jansen)**
    * *Goal:* Applying time-series analysis and financial ML strategies.
3.  **[SIDE] Deep Learning for Biology (Ravarani et al.)**
    * *Goal:* Understanding data representation for biological entities (Proteins, DNA).
